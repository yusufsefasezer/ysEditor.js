## Why should I use ysEditor.js
* No need any plugin - does not need any plugin or library.
* Easy to use - Create the HTML markup and start using it.
* Extensible - You can create custom button.
* Customizable - Customize editor element, editor button and other options.

## How to use

Compiled and production-ready code can be found in the `dist` directory. The `src` directory contains development code.

### 1. Include ysEditor on your site

```html
<script src="path/to/yseditor.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/yseditor.css" />
```

### 2. Create HTML markup

ysEditor uses the `<div id="yseditor"></div>` element by default.

```html
<div id="yseditor"></div>
```
### 3. Initialize ysEditor
In the footer of your page, after the content, initialize ysEditor.

```javascript
var myEditor = new ysEditor();
```

You can also look at the [examples](examples) directory for more

## ES6 Modules

ysEditor does not have a default export, but does support CommonJS and can be used with native ES6 module imports.

```javascript
import('path/to/yseditor.js')
  .then(function () {
    var myEditor = new ysEditor();
  });
``` 

It uses a UMD pattern, and should also work in most major module bundlers and package managers.

## Working with the Source Files

If you would prefer, you can work with the development code in the `src` directory using the included [Gulp build system](https://gulpjs.com/). This compiles and minifies code.

### Dependencies
Make sure these are installed first.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) `sudo npm install -g gulp`

### Quick Start

1. In bash/terminal/command line, `cd` into your project directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install required files.
3. When it's done installing, run one of the task runners to get going:
	* `gulp` manually compiles files.
	* `gulp watch` automatically compiles files.

## Options and Settings

ysEditor includes smart defaults and works right out of the box. But if you want to customize things, it also has a robust API that provides multiple ways for you to adjust the default options and settings.

### Global Settings

You can pass options and callbacks into ysEditor through the `init()` function:

```javascript
var myEditor = new ysEditor({
  wrapper: "#yseditor", // Editor wrapper

  // Toolbar options
  toolbar: [
    "undo", "redo", "bold", "italic", "underline",
    "strikethrough", "h1", "h2", "h3", "p", "quote",
    "left", "center", "right", "justify",
    "ol", "ul", "sub", "sup",
    "removeformat"],
  bottom: false,

  // Content options
  height: 200,
  scroll: false,
  includeContent: true,

  // Footer options
  footer: true,
  footerText: "Created by Yusuf Sezer"
});
```

#### defineButton()
Defines a button to be used in the toolbar.

```javascript
ysEditor.defineButton("name", {
	command: "",
	text: "",
	title: "",
	value: "",
	callback: function(button, editor){}
});
```

- **name** : Button name to be used in the toolbar options.
- **text** : Text that will appear in the toolbar.

- **command** (*optional*): Command to be executed when the button is clicked. [*Command list*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand)

- **callback** (*optional*): Callback function will work when the button is added to the toolbar.

});
```

});
```

  text: 'Words:',
  callback: function (button, editor) {
    var self = this;
    button.element.textContent = self.text + ' ' + editor.getText().split(' ').length;
    editor.element.addEventListener('keyup', function () {
      button.element.textContent = self.text + ' ' + editor.getText().split(' ').length;
    });
  }
});
```
**Example 4**

ysEditor.defineButton("bold", {
  command: "bold",

  text: "Bold" // Changed predefined text
});
```

### Use ysEditor events in your own scripts

  footer: false
});
```

```
